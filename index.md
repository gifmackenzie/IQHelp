## Unlock the Value of Vantaca IQ

**Vantaca IQ** is a focused business intelligence dashboard that provides a single source of truth for you associations' data and helps you uncover meaningful, actionable insights to drive performance, all from the convenience of **Vantaca's** community management performance software.

**Vantaca IQ** is composed of three levels, each with their own key insights and solutions:

	- Business IQ: Global view of all of your associations and employee's metrics.
	- Association IQ: Provides information about individual association activity and metrics
	- Employee IQ: Compare productivity data and identify areas for additional support and training


**Vantaca IQ** solves an industry-wide problem by being able to highlight and identify input metrics that affect an organization's day-to-day activity on both an individual and association level. While there are solutions that provide the same value and solutions, but these are not native to the existing workflows and can become expensive not only due to the reallocation of employee manpower, but also the delayed decision making due to the lack of immediate information.

There's never a delay with **Vantaca IQ**, the imperative information is always readily available.
